## vim-yaarp -- Yet Another Ascii Related Plugin

First Release Of Yaarp -- Yet another ascii related plugin
   +--------------------------------------------------------------------+
   |  Basically my attempt at implementing an ascii-art drawing plugin  |
   |    it is `Hideously Functional™´.                                  |
   +--------------------------------------------------------------------+
It is also much inspired by the plugin: DrawIt, by Charles E. Campbell.
